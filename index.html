                    <p>Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Multipurpose Project (SMDMP) is one of the National Pride Project being developed by Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation (Nepal). The project got the status of National Pride Project on 20 January 2020. The project is an inter-basin water transfer project aimed to transfer water from the Sunkoshi River to the Marin river, a tributary of the Bagmati River. The flow will be augumented to the Bagmati Irrigation System to irrigate an additional 122,000 ha of land in Rautahat, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, and Bara.</p>
